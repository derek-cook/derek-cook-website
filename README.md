## Welcome to my personal website!

I've gone through many iterations of my personal website at this point. I first used a template, then I made a vanilla html/css/js version from scratch. I figured, why not make it with all the bells and whistles of a typical project I might make. Normally the best technical decisions depend on the problem I'm solving. But for this latest version, I landed on what's been called the "T3 stack," see [init.tips](https://init.tips). I considered using something like Astro which might be better suited for more static apps. But I've experienced very quick traction using this stack, with many features I expect to use in the future. Surely some parts of this stack are overkill, for now.

In the future, I plan to add embedded demos of some interesting things I've built. For now, I'm going to take advantage of the static nature of the website by having pre-rendered pages (SSG) via Next. Stay tuned for updates.
